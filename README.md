Hi! I’m a Front-End developer and Python enthusiast with 4+ years of experience. I build interactive web interfaces and create automation tools using Python for web scraping, surveillance, and Telegram bots. I love turning ideas into efficient code and exploring creative tech solutions. Here, I share my projects, experiments, and coding insights.
